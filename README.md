# MusicPlayer

A simple music player that plays a folder of music files on shuffle. 
Hosts a webpage, which can be used to control the music (Play/Pause/Skip/Volume), 
as well as view upcoming songs and edit the queue of songs that will be played next. 
I use this player for my family's collection of Christmas music during the Christmas season, 
running on a Raspberry Pi, to play music through the entire house during Christmas parties and decorating. 
If anyone in the family wants to change the current song, they simply have to open the webpage on their phone, 
rather than dashing to the stereo to change songs.
